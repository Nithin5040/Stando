## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#6750A4), suggestive of efficiency and trustworthiness in financial matters.
- Background color: Light lavender (#F2EFF7), maintaining a visual relationship to the primary, yet subtle and unobtrusive.
- Accent color: Teal (#4CAF90), providing contrast, interest, and clear visual hierarchy, while remaining analogous to the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its modern and neutral appearance; well-suited to both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that are easily recognizable.
- Adopt a modern iOS 26 'glass theme' look (frosted glass aesthetic, using transparency and blur effects) to create an engaging and contemporary user experience. Focus on intuitive navigation and a clutter-free interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations (e.g., smooth transitions, loading animations) to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
